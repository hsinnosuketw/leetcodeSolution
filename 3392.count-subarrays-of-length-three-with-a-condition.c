 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,1,4,1]'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays of length 3 such
 * that the sum of the first and third numbers equals exactly half of the
 * second number.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,4,1]
 * 
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * Only the subarray [1,4,1] contains exactly 3 elements where the sum of the
 * first and third numbers equals half the middle number.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,1,1]
 * 
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * [1,1,1] is the only subarray of length 3. However, its first and third
 * numbers do not add to half the middle number.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 3 <= nums.length <= 100
 * -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
 * 
 *
